abstract = {The need to produce more efficient and less polluting vehicles has encouraged mass production of alternative energy vehicles, such as hybrid and electric cars. Many of these vehicles are capable of very quiet operation. While reducing noise pollution is desirable, quieter vehicles could negatively affect pedestrian safety because of reduced sound cues compared to louder internal combustion engines. Three studies were performed to investigate people's concern about this issue. In Study 1, a questionnaire completed by 378 people showed substantial positive interest in quiet hybrid and electric cars. However, they also indicated concern about the reduced auditory cues of quiet vehicles. In Study 2, 316 participants rated 14 sounds that could be potentially added to quietalternative-energy vehicles. The data showed that participants did not want annoying sounds, but preferred adding "engine" and "hum" sounds relative to other types of sounds. In Study 3, 24 persons heard and rated 18 actual sounds within 6 categories that were added to a video of a hybrid vehicle driving by. The sounds most preferred were "engine" followed by "white noise" and "hum". Implications for adding sounds to facilitate pedestrians' detection of moving vehicles and for aiding drivers' awareness of speed are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

@article{Poveda-Martinez2017,
abstract = {Electric and Hybrid Electric vehicles (EV and HEV) seem to be the future of transport in smart cities and the key for the total reduction of noise disturbance and pollution in urban areas. However, several problems have to be solved to guarantee the safety of these types of vehicle. Up to now, the use of HEV has shown the dangers of a “quiet” transport system in urban environments; in fact, it has been estimated that an HEV is twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash as would be an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in the same situation. With the aim of improving their safety, different kinds of warning sounds are being designed to increase the detectability of EV and HEV without themselves becoming new annoying sound sources. The sound directivity, frequency of emission and intensity of warning sound systems will guarantee their efficiency and limited noise impact. Several research works bring to the fore a significant variation of the pedestrian response time to different acoustic stimuli. However, it is necessary to examine the suitability of these warning sounds according to the urban environments in which they are going to be emitted. Distinct areas inside the city have different soundscapes whose spectral content can vary significantly, masking some of the sounds suggested as an alert. This paper analyses in detail the main characteristics of several warning sounds proposed by the industry, conducting a comparative study of the different design trends. A total of 131 sighted listeners were exposed to a virtual road-crossing test. The behaviour and appropriateness of warning sounds are analysed depending on the urban environment. For this purpose, three clearly different soundscapes have been selected: stopped vehicles at a traffic light, a pedestrian shopping area and the vicinity of a playground. The results highlight the wide variability in pedestrian reaction time for the different warning sounds used. Some signals considerably improve the detectability of the vehicle, providing results even above the ICE vehicle ones. However, other warning sounds do not decrease the reaction time with respect to the EV. In addition, a clear dependence is observed between the detectability and the soundscape involved, changing the results for the same warning sound depending on the acoustic environment.},

@article{Mendonca2013,
abstract = {Road traffic sounds are a major source of noise pollution in urban areas. But recent developments such as low noise pavements and hybrid/electric engine vehicles cast an optimistic outlook over such an environmental problem. However, it can be argued that engine, tire, and road noise could be relevant sources of information to avoid road traffic conflicts and accidents. In this paper, we analyze the potential trade-offs of traffic-noise abatement approaches in an experimental study, focusing for the first time on the impact and interaction of relevant factors such as pavement type, vehicle type, listener's age, and background noise, on vehicle detection levels. Results reveal that vehicle and pavement type significantly affect vehicle detection. Age is a significant factor, as both younger and older people exhibit lower detection levels of incoming vehicles. Low noise pavements combined with all-electric and hybrid vehicles might pose a severe threat to the safety of vulnerable road users. All factors interact simultaneously, and vehicle detection is best predicted by the loudness signal-to-noise ratio. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974. Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders.},
